# PhotoChrome - word-based color palettes

PhotoChrome was made by John Nelson and Vanni Zhang. We’re engineers at Esri, a geographic information systems software company. In the evenings, we can’t help ourselves cobbling together stuff like this. We made PhotoChrome as a convenient resource to generate hopefully-useful color palettes based on words. You type a word, and we’ll give you a color palette to match.

When you search a word, PhotoChrome reaches out to the beautiful Unsplash image service, smashes together all of the resulting photos, picks out the predominant colors from the photo soup, then tweaks their brightness so they range evenly from dark to light.

Are you a data geek, like us? Good news, the colors have been munged onto a linear brightness gradient so they might work for your visualization.

Are you a designer, like us? Good news, now you can crowdsource the creation of a color palette to get something like the consensus of a word. Are you a linguist? We’re not. But we do enjoy seeing the pragmatic internet hordes show us the colors of a word.
